Modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture

* Built a SQL Server–based data warehouse following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
* Loaded raw CSV data into the Bronze layer using bulk insert, keeping source data intact.
* Cleaned, standardised, and joined datasets in the Silver layer to create consistent, analysis-ready data.
* Created Gold-layer views for reporting and analytics, optimised for performance.
* Used SQL features such as CTEs, window functions, joins, indexing, and stored procedures to improve query efficiency.
* Designed the project for scalable analytics and clear separation of raw, processed, and business-ready data.
